Here they ask us to apply a .diff file to a text file. How does that work? So they give us file a, with a bunch of text inside, we make a copy of that file, and then they also give us the .diff file, which include the text changes to apply to the file b (the copy). So the command 'patch' does exactly that, applies a .diff file to an orignal file, and changes the text to however it's supposed to be. The command line used is 'patch b < sw.diff', which means it's going to patch file b with the .diff file.
