The command 'find' is going to find the files we tell it to, in this case, files that start and end with '#' and files that begin with a '~'. 
Type -f means that it is a file, and the '.' means that it's going to find the files in the directory and subdirectories. 
'-print' and '-delete' are executable flags, which means it's going to print those file names first and only then does it delete said files.
