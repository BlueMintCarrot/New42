Another script, this time that will show files that are ignored by our git repository. So how does this command work? The git status part is another git command to show the status of our repository, if we added files or not, if they were commited, whatever. The flag --ignored speaks for itself, I believe, we want to see the ignored files; the --short is to show us the output in a more compact format. Ignored files will show up with 'vim git_ignore.sh' before them, it's default. So the grep command picks that part from the line and then, if we want, does something with it (grep can be used to find something specific, for example, a computer hal always multiple processes running, if you want to find a specific one, you could use grep chrome, for example, and it will show you all chrome processes that are running); and the last bit, 'sed 's/^vim git_ignore.sh //' will replace that part with whatever you write down (sed is an editing tool), it will pick up the 'vim git_ignore.sh' part of the line, and will replace it with nothing (that's what the double slash means, nothing)
