Here they asked us for a .sh file (which refers to scripts, which can be used to do pretty much whatever. They want us to be able to show the last 5 commits on our repository, just the 'codes'. 
A git repository, you use it to store and access files, sort of, and the way you add them is with a series of commands, 'git add ...' and the files you want to add, then git commit -m ... which will prepare the files to be sent to the repository, with a message, and finally 'git push' which will actually send the files to the repository. 
So to show the last 5 commits, git log refers to the list of commits, the '-n 5' bit tells how many we want to show, and the flag --format knows it has to format the output somehow, and that's the %H part, so the computer knows it will only show the full 'commit code', and nothing else. 
The first line of the script refers to what should execute the script, for example the terminal on my pc is ohmyzsh, which can do things that maybe bash can't do, so here we tell it it should execute with bash
